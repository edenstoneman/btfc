                        <br>
                        Iron put up a tremendous fighting display on the South Coast the Saturday before Christmas and were desperately unlucky to lose against a vastly more experienced home side in what was new manager Ryan Maxwell's first defeat.
                        <br><br>
                        Without their seven cup-tied first team players Iron were for most of the game more than a match against the full-timers and although conceding what turned out to be the winning goal midway through the second half the manager's new work ethos and commitment from his players is a breath of fresh air and bodes well for the remainder of the current campaign as Iron bid to move up the table.
                        <br><br>
                        <em>"It was another good, all round performance from a made-up side with some young players competing so well at this level for the first time," </em>said Maxwell. <em>"I'm really proud of the lads which is a big plus point for the club.
                        <br><br>
                        "They all worked so hard against a much stronger and vastly more experienced side and the turning point of the game was when they brought on the hugely experienced Danny Kedwell just past the hour,"</em> he continued. <em>"We had worked a plan out to cope with him playing from the start but we knew with his vast experience once he did come on it may cause us some problems."</em>
                        <br><br>
                        Kedwell certainly made an impact setting up the only goal of the game on 72 minutes when his holding play up front and laying the ball off saw another substitute, Roarie Deacon, who slid the ball home from the edge of the Iron penalty box.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite this setback Iron continued to push hard for an equaliser with both Danny Bassett, who worked tireless up front all afternoon, and Gabriel Piorkowski going so close while in the final moments of the game Rondell Gordon and Arjavit Krasniqi almost each grabbed a goal.
                        <br><br>
                        A positive Maxwell added: <em>"Yes, I don't like ever losing and we're disappointed and to have lost by such a close margin but that's how football goes. We are now already planning for our next game at home to Chelmsford City."</em>
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="bold">Braintree Town: Jackson; Renee, Smith, Olomewewe, Clements; Allen, Krasniqi, Johnson, Gordon; Bassett, Piorkowski (76 Holness). Unused subs: MIskin, Vukasinovic, Cameron.</span>

                        <br>
                        Because of covid-related issues, our Boxing Day match at home to Chelmsford City was postponed.

                        <br>
                        The lack of clinical finishing from inside the home side's area was the only reason Iron returned from their visit to a fog shrouded New Lodge on Monday evening empty handed because overall they created more goal scoring chances than their hosts.
                        <br><br>
                        After a fairly even first half Iron certainly finally upped their tempo in the second half putting the home side's defence under sustained pressure which saw some desperate last minute defending plus four excellent saves from home keeper Dion-Curtis Henry who denied Danny Bassett (twice), Ken Charles and Correy Davidson from scoring.
                        <br><br>
                        The home side have that clinical finisher in Jake Robinson who always seems to have the knack of being in the right place at the right time to snap up chances.
                        <br><br>
                        He opened the scoring on 22 minutes nipping in to pick up a loose ball after Iron keeper Patrick Ohman had parried a low Ruben Soares shot and then four minutes from time with Iron pushing hard for an equaliser up at the other end he again snapped up a half chance to score his side's third goal.
                        <br><br>
                        Iron though will rue their missed chances against a much improved home side because it cost them the game even though the final scoreline really flattered the Blues.
                        <br><br>
                        After a slow start Iron grew more into the game with Tom Derry, Percy Kianbegni and Davidson all going close in that first period.
                        <br><br>
                        Iron then had the worse possible second half start conceding a second goal on 48 minutes when the tricky Soares caught the Iron backline napping and in a well worked move squeezed the ball in from close range.
                        <br><br>
                        To their credit Iron came back strongly putting concerted pressure on the home rearguard and they were given a lifeline back into the game on 52 minutes when skipper Matthew Johnson fired in an unstoppable 25-yard shot into the top corner of the home net, an outstanding strike worthy of a higher level.
                        <br><br>
                        As Iron kept pressing how they failed to score an equaliser was difficult to understand and substitute Charles twice saw his efforts from inside the area go narrowly wide while Kiangeni was also inches wide with keeper Henry beaten.
                        <br><br>
                        But with Iron continuing to push forward in the final minutes of the game it naturally left gaps at the back and on a rare home side breakaway the ever alert Robinson was able to sneak in to score a third goal.
                        <br><br>
                        Manager Ryan Maxwell felt his side did enough, particularly in the second half onslaught, to have earned at least at point but like any match it's all about taking some of the chances when a team has them in front of goal adding: "I'm disappointed obviously at the final outcome and the scoreline didn't really reflect the 90 minutes.
                        <br><br><em>"But we will regroup, get organised again and plan for Saturday learning from the lessons from this game,"</em> he added.

                        <br>
                        Four City goals within 16 minutes early in the second half completely transformed this local derby at the Melbourne Stadium on Saturday with the home side in the end deservedly running out winners and with it local bragging rights.
                        <br><br>
                        It was the proverbial game of two halves with Iron completely dominating the first 45 minutes, taking a two goal lead through Taofiq Olomowewe (18 minutes) and Tom Derry (39) and they could have easily have scored more to have taken what would have been an unassailable lead.
                        <br><br>
                        In a complete reverse though after the interval City were in total control from the start while Iron players lacked cohesion and organisation with too many passes going astray and unforgivingly giving silly, needless free-kicks away from which City capitalised, scoring three of their goals from set pieces as a result.
                        <br><br>
                        The early warning signs were then on 54 minutes when from a right wing corner Charlie Sheringham was his usual predatory self by scooping the ball home from close range and six minutes later again from an unnecessary given away free-kick City skipper Tom Wraigh tstruck home a superb shot into the top corner of the net to draw his side level.
                        <br><br>
                        With City by now rampant and a shell-shocked Iron completely all at sea they took the lead on 63 minutes when former Iron midfielder Cameron James was able to slip through past static defenders to score practically unchallenged.
                        <br><br>
                        On 70 minutes the comeback was completed when Iron full-back Nathan Smith dallied too long on the ball bringing down City's Daniel Imray inside the Iron area leaving referee Tom Danaher no choice but to award a penalty which Adam Morgan duly converted.
                        <br><br>
                        Iron manager Ryan Maxwell made three substitutions in quick succession in a bid to revive his shattered players but although they rally and cause a few anxious moments in the home defence with four good efforts on goal it was all too little too late.
                        <br><br>
                        It was another Jekyll and Hyde performance from Iron who remain rooted to the bottom of the league and they will need to up their game and full concentration when they entertain high-riding Dartford this coming Saturday at Cressing Road.
