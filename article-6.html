                        Iron came within sixty seconds of making it three wins in a row for new boss Ryan Maxwell only to see their Kent visitors snatch a dramatic equaliser but the point gained at least moves the side off the bottom of the league at Cressing Road on Tuesday evening.
                        <br><br>
                        In an enthralling encounter with end to end play the 90 minutes, played yet again behind closed doors, it looked to be going in Iron's favour when on 81 minutes Corry Davidson curled over a left wing free-kick for Tom Derry to outjump the tall Welling defenders to head home a fine poachers goal.
                        <br><br>
                        But a minute from normal time Iron gave away a free-kick out on their right flank and when the ball was lofted over into the area it conveniently fell to the feet of Dipoplonabi Akinyemi with his back to goal but he swivelled on the spot to fire in a tremendous right foot shot into the far top corner of the net for the equaliser.
                        <br><br>
                        Over the 90 minutes a draw was probably a fair result for any neutral watching although this new look Iron side at times played some really impressive football with new striker Joe Leslie, signed from Woking, immediately finding his feet alongside Derry in attack and caused the visiting rearguard problems all evening.
                        <br><br>
                        The physically strong visitors though had their moments and in the first half should have scored twice with easy chances and then on the half hour ex-Iron midfielder Della Verde saw his shot cleared off the home goal line.
                        <br><br>
                        On 32 minutes though the Iron scored what appeared to be a superb goal when the ball was swept up right down the right wing, Johnville Renee outpaced the defence to the byline before sending over a great high ball to the back post where Davidson ran in and volleyed the ball into the net.
                        <br><br>
                        But to the amazement of Iron players referee Paul Johnson was then alerted to an assistant referee's flag still raised right up at the other end of the field where it was claimed the ball had gone out of play for a throw-in before the Iron swiftly moved the game upfield.
                        <br><br>
                        It was a disheartening change of mind by the referee which clearly upset the Iron players and he disallowed the goal and brought the game right back to the opposite flank deep in the Iron half.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite this setback the longer the game went on the more the Iron regained their confidence although in the first two minutes of the restart after half time Iron keeper Patrick Ohman pulled off a fine save from Rowan Liburo to keep out what looked a certain goal.
                        <br><br>
                        Iron certainly pressed hard late on in the second half with both Arjanit Krasniqi and Derry going close and then with 15 minutes to go Derry and Davidson almost broke the deadlock only to see their efforts charged down and cleared by some frantic last minute defending.
                        <br><br>
                        Iron boss Maxwell brought on two subs in Rohdell Gordon and Danny Bassett to give his side some fresh legs and again both players went close to scoring while up at the other end Taofiq Olomowewe, who had an outstanding game in the heart of the Iron defence twice foiled the visitors from breaking clear on goal.
                        <br><br>
                        Once Iron did take the lead they did try to hold but Akinyemi's super late strike in the dying moments ensured the points were shared while Maxwell was nonetheless pleased with his side's continued improvement as they strive to move away from the relegation zone.
