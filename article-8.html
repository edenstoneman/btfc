                        Iron pulled off an FA Trophy win at New Lodge on Tuesday evening by beating their hosts in a penalty shootout after the 90 minutes had ended all square at 1-1.
                        <br><br>
                        Iron manager Ryan Maxwell had been able to conjure up replacement players, including two youngsters from Step 7 in the pyramid that included winger Gabriel Pioskowski (from Hayes & Yeading) and 20 year-old full-back Mack Miskin (from Northwood), to see his side put on a creditable display and more than holding their own against a vastly more experienced home side.
                        <br><br>
                        Along with debutant young keeper Simon Jackson, who had an outstanding game, manager Maxwell was also forced to start with some fringe first team players with the newcomers never having even trained together the players before the game.
                        <br><br>
                        <em>"I'm really proud of all the players and in particular the young ones who were thrown in at the deep yet they responded magnificently,"</em> said Maxwell. <em>"We managed to set a game plan before kick off and everyone stuck to it and played their part which was really rewarding.
                        <br><br>
                        "Even when we went behind in the second half I knew we would come back at them and once we equalised we had a couple of great chances to have won the game," </em>he continued.<em> "All the squad showed great tenacity and worked their socks off for one another and we deserved to go to Havant in the next round on Saturday."</em>
                        <br><br>
                        The game was played at a fast pace and several times in the first half the Iron broke clear but missed their goal chances whilst at the other end the defence, exceptionally well marshalled by both Taofiq Olomowewe and Kyran Clements, always looked strong and the pair managed to keep top scorer Jake Robinson quiet all evening.
                        <br><br>
                        The early part of the second half saw the home side press hard for the opening goal and it duly came on 65 minutes when Robinson skipper away down the right before crossing a low ball into the Iron penalty box where Ruben Soares JR crashed the ball in at the far post.
                        <br><br>
                        Undeterred by this sudden setback the Iron came back strongly causing the home defence all kinds of problems with Danny Bassett, Rhondell Gordon and George Allen all narrowly missing the target.
                        <br><br>
                        Some shrewd change of tactics and substitutions by Maxwell paid off too and they were finally rewarded on 78 minutes when the impressive midfielder Arjanit Krasniqi sent in a 30 yard rocket of a shot into the far top corner of the home net for the equaliser.
                        <br><br>
                        It was no more than Iron deserved at this stage and in the final flurry of attacks both substitute Luke Holness and Gordon went so close to scoring the winning goal.
                        <br><br>
                        At the final whistle and with no extra time in the competition it came down to a penalty shootout and Gordon, Matthew Johnson, Johnville Renee and debutant and substitute Jake Clowsley all scored from the penalty spot but when the home side's Frankie Sutherland kick was brilliantly saved by Jackson and then Joe Felix launched his effort over the grandstand it gave the Iron a 4-2 win from the penalty spot.
