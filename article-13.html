                        A goal three minutes into added time at the end of 90 minutes cruelly robbed Iron of at least a deserved point in an entertaining encounter at Arbour Park on Saturday.
                        <br><br>
                        It mean for the second game in a row Iron lost by one goal and like against Oxford City in midweek they had done more than enough to have drawn this game played again behind closed doors.
                        <br><br>
                        Iron, who have a debut to new goalkeeper Jack Giddens, 28, the former Billericay Town and East Thurrock Utd stopper, were also without influential players which meant manager Ryan Maxwell reshuffling his starting line up with fit again Kyran Clements and George Allen back in the side.
                        <br><br>
                        In an end to end game Iron again played as they had in the second half against Dartford but were unlucky to go behind on 39 minutes with a deflected goal from the home side's Warren Harris.
                        <br><br>
                        Iron though were level just two minutes later when Arjanit Krasniqi chased down a loose ball to the home keeper and was able to slide it into the net although before both goals Corry Davidson and Tom Derry saw shots scrambled away off the home goal line.
                        <br><br>
                        It was the same in the second half with both sides attacking hard yet again it was the home side who snatched the lead on 57 minutes when Ben Harris headed home but again Iron struck back quickly through the livewire Ade Yussuf.
                        <br><br>
                        He was hauled down in the area just past the hour and he dusted himself down to slot the penalty home to level up the teams.
                        <br><br>
                        Iron continued to press hard for a winning goal and they were unlucky on 71 minutes when a Derry header came back of the inside the home post and 10 minutes later Davidson was unlucky when his shot was somehow blocked on the home goal line before being cleared.
                        <br><br>
                        But despite all these threats football can be a cruel game and just when it looked as both sides were going to earn a point each the home side's Ryan Bird managed to squeeze the ball home in this third minute of stoppage time leaving Iron players shattered.
                        <br><br>
                        But it was yet a continued overall improving display by Iron who now go to Maidstone United on Tuesday evening looking for a win against their old manager, Hakan Hanrettin.
